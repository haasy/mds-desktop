Development Environment
#######################

This chapter provides instructions on how to setup the recommended development environment for the MDS-Desktop project, as well as the technologies used.
The MDS-Desktop app is built, on top of :vite-electron-builder-homepage:`vite-electron-builder <>` as an :electron-homepage:`Electron <>` application which uses :vue-homepage:`Vue.js <>` to render the ui and :vite-homepage:`Vite <>` to build the vue.js application.
As an Electron app this application is built on top of :node-homepage:`Node.js <>` and uses the :npm-homepage:`npm <>` package manager for dependency management and the build process.
